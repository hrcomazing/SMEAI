"""Pipeline for building the FAISS index and metadata store."""

# Pseudocode outline for build_index
# 1. Load raw documents from external sources or local files.
# 2. Split documents into chunks using functions from ``chunking_utils``.
# 3. Embed chunks using a sentence transformer model.
# 4. Store embeddings in a FAISS index and write metadata mapping IDs to text
#    and authorized user IDs.
#
# Actual implementation would require dependencies like ``sentence-transformers``
# and ``faiss``. Those are not included in this skeleton.
